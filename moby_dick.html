        The <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">softcover</a> 
	publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like 
	the
        <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em>
	book</a> and <a href="http://learenough.com/html"><em>
	Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, 
	but it's also good for making more traditional books, 
	such as the novel <em>Moby-Dich</em> by Herman melville 
	(sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). Wepresent 
	below a shot and affectionately irreverent book report 
	on this classic of American literature.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago-never
	  mind how long precisely-having little or no money in
	  my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
	  shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see
          the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of 
	  driving off the spleen and regulating the 
  	  circulation.
	</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be
	good for you), Ishmael then gots on in much the same
	vein dor approximately one jillion pages. The only
	thing bigger than Moby Dick (who-<em>spiler alert!</em>
	-is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
